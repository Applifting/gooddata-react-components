# Gooddata React examples

This is example catalogue with basic showcases of what is possible to do with [@gooddata/react-components](https://github.com/gooddata/gooddata-react-components).

### Running examples

By default it runs with `@gooddata/react-components` aliased to `../dist`, 
so you have to install & build the parent folder first.

```
gooddata-react-components $ yarn install
gooddata-react-components $ cd examples
gooddata-react-components/examples $ yarn install
gooddata-react-components/examples $ yarn dev
```
Then visit [https://localhost:8999](https://localhost:8999).

All examples use metrics,attributes and visualizations from the 'RAIL demo project'. 
Please make sure you have access to this project. You may find its projectId in [catalogs/catalog-secure.json](catalogs/catalog-secure.json)
